Are you a beginner in the field of machine learning and wondering how to bring your project to live. I'm was in the same situation when I started learning ML.
Most of the ML courses focus on EDA,feature engineering and model tuning and ignore the model deployment.

The end goal of any machine learning model is making it available for end user for consumption. However deploying model has it own challenges and it also differs where you are going to deploy the model (Azure,AWS,GCP,heroku etc.).Â 
In this repository I will help you to deploy your model using Flask and Heroku. Flask is a micro web framework that does not require particular tools or libraries to create web applications and easy to protype.Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
